## Software Concept 

A combination of frontend and backend technologies to provide **a seamless booking experience**. On the frontend, we utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. To enhance development speed and maintainability, we integrate a frontend framework like React or Angular, along with a UI library such as Bootstrap or Material-UI, ensuring seamless navigation and interaction for customers. Meanwhile, on the backend, we employ robust server-side languages like Python or Java, coupled with frameworks like Spring Boot, to handle complex business logic and data processing. To store and manage hotel room inventory and customer reservations, we integrate with databases like MySQL or MongoDB, ensuring data integrity and scalability. This tech stack enables us to deliver a feature-rich and scalable hotel booking platform that caters to the needs of both customers and hotel staff alike.
